### Hi there 👋
My name is **Adithya Venkatarao** | 💻 Software Engineer @ [**Veeva**](https://www.veeva.com/) | 📚 Computer Science @ **University of Waterloo** | 🌎 Working remotely from ❄️Toronto, Canada ☃️

I'm super passionate about Computer Graphics 🖼️ and spending a lot of my free time developing applications using graphics APIs, learning about rendering techniques, writing highly performant software on both the CPU and GPU, among other things. I also enjoy playing video games (RPGs and Strategy mostly) :video_game:, reading sci-fi/fantasy books :book: and investing :chart_with_upwards_trend:. Feel free to reach out on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/adithyavenkatarao/) 👔 if any of these topics are of interest to you, or just to say hi!
